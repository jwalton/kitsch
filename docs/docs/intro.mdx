## What is it?

Kitsch prompt is a cross-platform program for displaying a prompt in your shell. It is designed to be highly customizable, both in terms of what gets displayed, and in terms of how it gets displayed. Kitsch prompt supports rendering text using gradients, makes it easy to generate powerline-style prompts, and makes use of the Go template engine so you can design prompts where the only limit is your imagination.

## Installation

Kitsch prompt installs just a single executable, so it's easy to try out. It supports Linux, Windows, and MacOS, and supports a number of different shells. On Linux or Mac, you can install kitsch by running:

```sh
$ curl https://kitschprompt.com/install.sh | sh
```

Running the script will install kitsch on your system in /usr/local/bin, and display instructions on how to try it out, and how to setup your shell configuration files. On Mac, you can also install via Homebrew:

```sh
$ brew install jwalton/tap/kitsch
```

If you want to install on Windows, or want more detailed instructions, check out [the advanced installation instructions](./advancedInstallation.mdx).

## Changing Your Prompt

After following the setup instructions, kitsch prompt is ready to go, and will display a beautiful prompt out-of-the-box. If you want change how your prompt looks, you can start by using one of the [sample configuration files](https://github.com/jwalton/kitsch/tree/master/sampleconfig). First, find your configuration folder. Kitsch prompt stores configuration in a hierarchical YAML file. The location of this file will depend on your operating system:

- On Linux and MacOS: `~/.config/kitsch/kitsch.yaml`.
- On Windows: `%appdata%\Roaming\kitsch\kitsch\kitsch.yaml`

You can figure out where configuration is stored by running `kitsch configdir`.

Grab any configuration file and copy it to "kitsch.yaml" in your configuration directory. The sample configurations are a great place to build from, but be sure to check out the [configuration tutorial](./configuration.mdx).

After you make changes to your configuration file, run `kitsch check [config-file]` to verify your configuration file.
