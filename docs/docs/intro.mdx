## What is it?

Kitsch-prompt is a cross-platform program for displaying a prompt in your shell. It is designed to be highly customizable, both in terms of what gets displayed, and in terms of how it gets displayed. Kitsch-prompt supports rendering text using gradients, makes it easy to generate powerline-style prompts, and makes use of the Go template engine so you can design prompts where the only limit is your imagination.

## Changing Your Prompt

After following the installation instructions, kitsch-prompt is ready to go, and will display a beautiful prompt out-of-the-box. If you want change how your prompt looks, you can start by using one of the [sample configuration files](https://github.com/jwalton/kitsch-prompt/tree/master/sampleconfig). First, find your configuration folder. Kitsch-prompt stores configuration in a hierarchical YAML file. The location of this file will depend on your operating system:

- On Linux and MacOS: `~/.config/kitsch-prompt/kitsch.yaml`.
- On Windows: `%appdata%\Roaming\kitsch-prompt\kitsch-prompt\kitsch.yaml`

You can figure out where configuration is stored by running `kitsch-prompt configdir`.

Grab any configuration file and copy it to "kitsch.yaml" in your configuration directory. The sample configurations are a great place to build from, but be sure to check out the [configuration tutorial][./configuration.mdx].

After you make changes to your configuration file, run `kitsch-prompt check [config-file]` to verify your configuration file.
