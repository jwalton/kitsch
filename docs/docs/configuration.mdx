# Configuration Basics

import ExamplePrompt from "../src/components/ExamplePrompt";

Kitsch-prompt stores configuration in a hierarchical YAML file. The location of this file will depend on your operating system:

- On Linux and MacOS: `~/.config/kitsch-prompt/kitsch.yaml`.
- On Windows: `%appdata%\Roaming\kitsch-prompt\kitsch-prompt\kitsch.yaml`

You can figure out where configuration is stored by running `kitsch-prompt configdir`.

Here is a pretty basic configuration file:

```yaml
# kitsch.yaml
prompt:
  type: block
  modules:
    - type: directory
      style: cyan
    - type: prompt
```

This will print the name of the current directory, followed by a "$" prompt (or a "#" prompt if you're logged in as root), and color the directory cyan:

```kitsch
globals:
  cwd: /users/jwalton/documents/work
---
prompt:
  type: block
  modules:
    - type: directory
      style: cyan
    - type: prompt
```

Let's break this file down line by line. The first line is `prompt:`, which defines the "root module" for the prompt. In kitsch-prompt, the basic building block is the module. Each module takes some configuration and generates some output. There are modules that print out the current username, the current directory, the type of project you are currently using, how long the last command took. If there's not a module that does what you want, you can use a custom module to call out to the shell.

The next line is `type: block` - this says that the root module is a "block" module. The "block" module is a special module which joins together multiple children, separating each by a space (by default). Line 3, the `modules:` line, gives the list of modules that this block will render.

The `type: directory, style: cyan` creates a "directory" module, which renders the current working directory. The `style:` key is something that can be applied to any module, and tells kitsch-prompt to render the output of this module in cyan. View the [styles documentation](./styles.mdx) for a complete description of styles. Finally the `type: prompt` creates a prompt module, which displays the final "$ ".

Let's see another example:

```yaml
# kitsch.yaml
prompt:
  type: block
  style: brightBlue
  modules:
    - type: block
      join: "@"
      modules:
        - type: username
        - type: hostname
    - type: directory
      style: cyan
    - type: prompt
```

This will render:

```kitsch
globals:
  cwd: /users/jwalton/documents/work
---
prompt:
  type: block
  style: brightBlue
  modules:
    - type: block
      join: "@"
      modules:
        - type: username
        - type: hostname
    - type: directory
      style: cyan
    - type: prompt
```

Hmm... This looks exactly the same. This is because the "username" and "hostname" module are "smart". They will only generate output if we're logged in via SSH. The "block" module will ignore any child modules that didn't generate any output. We can force "username" and "hostname" to generate output with:

```yaml
modules:
  - type: username
    showAlways: true
    style: bold
  - type: hostname
    showAlways: true
```

And then we'll get:

```kitsch
globals:
  cwd: /users/jwalton/documents/work
---
prompt:
  type: block
  style: brightBlue
  modules:
    - type: block
      join: "@"
      modules:
        - type: username
          showAlways: true
        - type: hostname
          showAlways: true
    - type: directory
      style: cyan
    - type: prompt
```

Something to note here is that the "directory" module colors it's output cyan, and the outer block colors it's content brightBlue, but the directory remains cyan.  Under the hood, kitsch-prompt uses the [gchalk](https://github.com/jwalton/gchalk) library, which will handle "nested" colors like this correctly.
