$ Configuration Merging

You can have one configuration file "extend" another.  The parent configuration will be loaded and merged with the child:

- If the child has no  "prompt", the prompt will be copied from the parent.
- Custom colors will be merged with colors from the child overriding colors from the parent.
- Projects will be merged with any projects in the child overriding projects from the parent.

For example, suppose we have this parent.kitsch.yaml file:

```yaml
# parent.kitsch.yaml

colors:
  $foreground: cyan
prompt:
  type: block
  modules:
    - type: directory
      style: $foreground
    - type: prompt
```

We could extend this file in child.kitsch.yaml:

```yaml
# child.kitsch.yaml

extends: ./parent.kitsch.yaml
colors:
  $foreground: green
```

This would render a green directory instead of a cyan directory.
