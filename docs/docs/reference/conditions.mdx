# Conditions

Conditions can be set on any module or any project definition.  On project definitions they are used to decide if the current folder is of the specified project type.  On a module, they are used to prevent the module from running unless the conditions are met.

The following is a list of valid conditions:

- `ifFiles: ["file1", "file2", "file3"]` - The condition is met if one or more of the files is present in the current folder.
- `ifAncestorFiles: ["file1", "file2", "file3"]` - The condition is met if one or more of the files is present in the current folder, or any folder higher up the directory hierarchy.
- `ifExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "ts", "tsx"]` - The condition is met if one or more of the extensions is present in the current folder.
- `onlyIfOS: ["darwin", "linux"] - The condition is met only if the OS is one of the OSs listed.
- `onlyIfNotOS: ["windows"]` - The conditions is met only be shown if the OS is not one of the listed OSs.

Note that "if*" conditions are "or"ed together - if any one of these conditions is met, the "conditions" block is considered met.. The "onlyIf*" conditions are "and" conditions - if they are not met, the conditions will not be fulfilled, even if other conditions match.
