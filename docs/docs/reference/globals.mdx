## CWD

`{{ .Globals.CWD }}` is the current working directory.

## LogicalCWD

`{{ .Globals.LogicalCWD }}` is the directory to show on the prompt.  This is used in Windows when you do something like `cd env:`.  In this case your LogicalCWD will be "Env:\", but your CWD will be your home directory.

## Home

## Jobs

`{{ .Globals.Jobs }}` is the number of jobs that the shell is currently running.

## Status

`{{ .Globals.Status }}` is an integer representing the return status of the previous command.

## PreviousCommandDuration

`{{ .Globals.PreviousCommandDuration }}` is the duration of the previous command, in milliseconds.

## Keymap

`{{ .Globals.Keymap }}` is the zsh/fish keymap. This will be "" if vi mode is not enabled, "" or "main" in insert mode, and "vicmd" in normal mode.

## Shell

`{{ .Globals.Shell }}` is the type of the shell (e.g. "zsh", "bash", "powershell", etc...).
